They get access to internal sales chats, have a corporate Binerals email address, and act on our behalf in dedicated regions.

        'We started our cooperation with Binerals 1.5 year ago. At first, I was a bit concerned about their offer as at that moment I wasn’t sure of their proficiency. One day, one of my clients was looking for a software development team and I advised him Binerals.My client decided to test a team and gave them a little task to complete. We both were totally shocked! Speed, delivery, quality - everything was on a top-notch level! After that, a team of 6 developers started working on my client’s project and continue doing this till this day.I am really happy that I connected with Igor (Co-Founder) and we started our partnership, because besides being professionals, they are also great people with excellent sense of humor.',

Several months later, my friend who runs own business, was looking for a dev team as he was planning a new product for his company. And then I remembered about Binerals. I connected them and in several weeks the project started. I am ready to admit that such cooperation is very profitable for all sides and doesn't take a lot of effort, especially for people with a huge business network.",
